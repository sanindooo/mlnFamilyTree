title: MLN Story - The Life of Martin Luther Nsibirwa
---

# Early Years

Born in Buganda Kingdom during a transformative period in Uganda's history. Nsibirwa learned to read and write in Sir Apollo Kaggwa's household, worked with land surveyors, and used maps to follow news about Buganda.

# Education and Service Beginnings

Nsibirwa was involved in fighting for the British in Tanganyika against the Germans in 1915. He also supported the British in World War II, sending family members including his son Siira Bugembe, nephews Yafesi Ssali and Labani Kiggundu, and three other young men to fight. One youth, Alikisanda Bbembe, stayed in the army until 1979. Nsibirwa tracked WWII progress with pins on a map and contributed salary to support Ugandan soldiers (Abaseveni or seventh battalion).

# The First Years of Service

Before 1920, Nsibirwa was assigned as chief for the sub-county of Mutuba VI in Kasawo. He worked to develop the area by increasing coffee and cotton production, improving food crop production, and fighting widespread hunger, demonstrating his capacity. Despite being only a Gombolola chief, he was able to attend and hold his own amongst great men of the time.

# Rising Leadership

In 1922, Nsibirwa was appointed Saza Chief of Bugerere, which was a personal joy as it was his home county, where he continued to improve cash and food crop production. In 1924, he was appointed acting Saza chief of Ssingo (the Mukwenda), described as a great honor due to Ssingo being a high-profile county of Buganda. Traveling from Bugerere to Ssingo took two days on foot, marking it as a sign of physical ability.

In 1925, he returned to Bugerere and continued his efforts to improve the agricultural practices of the residents. He used a bicycle for tours. The depopulation of Bulondoganyi due to a sleeping sickness epidemic led to his decision to establish a home in Kyaggwe, specifically in an area called Namakomo, which remains the family's ancestral home.

He once hunted and captured a lion that was terrorizing the people of the area. He believed that not killing the lion would make him a coward in the context of his mission to serve Kabaka and protect the people.

In 1927, after the death of Sir Apollo Kaggwa, he returned to Ssingo as Mukwenda. He traveled by bicycle and lorry, and made many friends during his time as Mukwenda, including Kajongolo Kamya (a leading man in Ssingo and father of Bulandira Bagenda, Dr. Latima Musoke, George Kalanzi), Masembe (chief overseer of the palace during Sir Edward Muteesa's time), and the father of Mrs. Joyce Mpanga (who served as minister of education in the 1980s).

He had routine meetings with sub-county chiefs who would bring administrative information from all 20 counties. He also traveled around the counties to ensure road maintenance.

# Family and Legacy

Martin Luther Nsibirwa's children and grandchildren gathered at Namakomo in September 1985, continuing the family legacy.

# Katikkiro of Buganda

Nsibirwa handled a tax deficiency by making chiefs own the loss and recovering funds. A tax deficiency was considered a dishonor for a chief.

In 1928, Nsibirwa was appointed as treasurer (Omuwanika). His office was located where the Juvenile Court and later Nabagereka Primary School would be. In his inaugural speech, he pledged to guard the kingdom's funds despite not being trained in accounting. He initiated construction for the new Twekobe (the Kabaka's main residence) and homes for the Katikiro and other chiefs.

The Buganda treasury was the wealthiest in East Africa during those days, and Nsibirwa began collecting funds for the Bulange.

Nsibirwa became Katikkiro in 1929, the highest position a commoner could achieve in Buganda. His monthly salary was 1,000 shillings and pension was 333 shillings. He had official land in Kalasa, Luweero, which provided food for his household and enabled him to educate his children, siblings' children, and friends.

One of his most important duties as Katikkiro was introducing heirs to the Kabaka when a landowner died.

# Marriage and Home Life

Katikkiro Nsibirwa married Damali Nawaggi in Church in 1905 but later married a few more wives:

1. Veronica Namudu (Jjaja Bugerere)
2. Erina Nankya (Jjaja Seeta)
3. Kasalina Naku Ntabade (Jjaja Nakulabye)
4. Maama Naome (also mother of Kosia Waggwa)
5. Maama Naome (mother of Joyce Nakalema Serunjogi)
6. Mama Edisa Nabunya (mother of Seruwagi)

Within Butikiro (the official residence of the Katikkiro), there were several houses. Mama Damali resided in the main Butikiro house, while the other Maama's (mothers/wives) lived in different houses with their children. There were also houses for young boys, relatives of his wives, and nephews whom he treated as his own children and educated at Mengo Secondary School.

All children grew up as one unit regardless of age or mother. He loved all his children equally and provided them with equal opportunities for education. This unity has been passed on from generation to generation.

# From Generation to Generation

Nsibirwa was a very religious man who led family prayers in the evenings with his children, emphasizing quality time. He was baptized young, became a deep believer in God and the Church. Despite having several wives, he observed church laws, praying every morning at Namirembe Cathedral before starting his duties and in the evenings at home.

Bishop CS Stuart, observing Nsibirwa's devotion, suggested he receive Holy Communion. Nsibirwa declined, stating, "Bishop my weakness should not violate the laws of God." This was because the Church did not permit individuals with multiple wives or those not married in the Church to take Holy Communion. Consequently, he never received communion until his death.

Within his family he had basic stewards and servants:

a) Malaki Matovu: The driver till the 5th September 1945 for about 13 to 14 years.

b) Yakoba Nsubuga: Steward who administered all the finances in the home to everyone as was needed. He lived with his wife and children and also had his children educated at Nsibirwa's cost, boys at Mengo High School and girls at Gayaza High School.

c) Anderea: Washing and ironing of Nsibirwa's clothes. Anderea always wore a Kanzu, was very tidy and nice. He never had a wife yet was highly disciplined.

d) Leo Ssebingi: His main job was to take the children on the bicycle for regular injections for malaria to Mulago, Mengo or Rubaga Hospital.

e) Yosia Musisi: Driver of the Butikiro Lorry which went routinely to Kalasa, Bulemezi to bring Matooke for feeding the Home of Katikiro's population. Residents in Kalasa had to provide the matooke once a week for all the Katikiro as a tax. The lorry was known as "Luwalo! (Compulsory Tax)" - Kalasa was the official land for the Katikkiro welfare.

f) Sowedi: The Butcher of Goats and other animals.

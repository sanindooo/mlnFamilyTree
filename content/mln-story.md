## Background

Martin Luther Nsibirwa was born in 1883 at Kirindi in Bugerere County to Kiwana—son of Munyagwa of the Nvuma clan—and Bulyaba Namusoke of the Mpindi clan. His upbringing blended Ssese Island roots with the Musoga influence of his stepmother Kafuko, who nurtured him when his mother was absent. Baptized around 1895, he was likely named after the Protestant reformer by his uncle Temitewo Mulondo or by Sir Apollo Kaggwa, whose household he later joined as a page.

Life in Sir Apollo Kaggwa’s residence instilled discipline, eloquence, and duty. Nsibirwa learned to read, write, and survey land, supervised important events, cared for Kaggwa’s children, and carried messages throughout Buganda and Busoga. He tracked global affairs on a map dotted with pins, followed the news closely, and used every assignment to build resilience.

Nsibirwa served the British in Tanganyika during World War I and later supported World War II by funding and dispatching his son Siira Bugembe, nephews Yafesi Ssali and Labani Kiggundu, and other youths to the front. Administratively, he became Gombolola chief of Mutuba VI, Saza Chief of Bugerere in 1922, and acting Saza Chief of Ssingo in 1924, tirelessly improving coffee, cotton, and food production, convening county chiefs, and traveling on bicycle or lorry to maintain roads and public order. He even hunted a marauding lion, unwilling to abandon his duty to protect the people.

## Career Highlights

Nsibirwa’s career peaked under Kabaka Sir Daudi Chwa II, who retained him as Katikkiro until 1939 and entrusted him with raising princes George William Kimbugwe and Henry Kimera. He organized royal weddings, initiated the rebuilding of Twekobe and official residences for chiefs, safeguarded Bulange’s treasury, and mobilized educated Baganda youth—including his sons—to fight abroad during World War II.

The British government honored him as a Member of the British Empire, and Kabaka Chwa awarded him the ceremonial title Master of Shield and Spear. Kabaka Muteesa II later praised him as a wise elder who could discern the right course of action and execute it swiftly. Nsibirwa also championed progressive reforms, exemplified by his decision—alongside Hamu Mukasa—to support the Namasole’s remarriage after Chwa’s death. Though that stance led to his resignation in 1941, it highlighted his belief that custom could evolve when justice demanded it.

## Family

Nsibirwa married Damali Nawaggi in 1905 and went on to wed Veronica Namudu (Jjaja Bugerere), Erina Nankya (Jjaja Seeta), Kasalina Naku Ntabade (Jjaja Nakulabye), Maama Naome (mother to Kosayi Waggwa and Joyce Nakalema Serunjogi), and Mama Edisa Nabunya (mother of Seruwagi). Within the vast Butikiro compound, each mother managed a household, yet all children were raised together—educated at Mengo Secondary School and bound by nightly prayers led by Nsibirwa.

Faith anchored his life: he prayed every morning at Namirembe Cathedral, held evening devotions with his family, and humbly declined Holy Communion because of the Church’s teachings on plural marriage. The household relied on loyal staff—driver Malaki Matovu, financial steward Yakoba Nsubuga, valet Anderea, medical aide Leo Ssebingi, lorry driver Yosia Musisi (who ferried matooke from Kalasa as a royal tax), and butcher Sowedi. Their service reflected the order, generosity, and unity that continue to define the Nsibirwa clan today.

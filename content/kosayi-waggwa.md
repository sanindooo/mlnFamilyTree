## Early Life

Kosayi Waggwa, born in 1927, was the sixth son and thirteenth child of Katikkiro Martin Luther Nsibirwa and Naome Kipnade. He studied at King's College Budo for junior and senior school before continuing to Bukalasa Agricultural College in Wobulenzi, Luweero.

## Work and Service

In the late 1950s, Kosayi settled in Kiti Village (Nangabo Ggombolola, Kyadondo County) and established a transport business running between Kasangati and Matugga. As the guerrilla wars of the early 1980s intensified, he moved to Namakomo to manage the greater Nsibirwa family farm. He remained there until his passing in 1998, following a battle with prostate cancer. Known for impeccable neatness and a disciplined, caring approach with children, he left a memorable impression on his siblings and the wider family.

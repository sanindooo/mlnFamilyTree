            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Martin Luther Nsibirwa was born in 1883 at Kirindi in Bugerere County to Kiwana—son of Munyagwa of the Nvuma clan—and Bulyaba Namusoke of the Mpindi clan. His childhood blended Ssese Island heritage with the Musoga influence of his stepmother Kafuko, who nurtured him after his mother’s early absence. Baptized around 1895, he was likely named after the Protestant reformer by his uncle Temitewo Mulondo or by Sir Apollo Kaggwa, whose household he later joined as a page.</p>
            <p>Life in Sir Apollo Kaggwa’s home shaped Nsibirwa’s discipline, eloquence, and sense of duty. Pages learned public decorum, endurance, and the history of Buganda’s chiefs, and Nsibirwa excelled—trusted to supervise events, care for Kaggwa’s children, and undertake missions across the kingdom, even into Busoga. He learned to read, write, and survey land, mapping the entire kingdom and following world events on a wall map dotted with pins.</p>
            <p>By 1915 he served in Tanganyika during World War I, and during World War II he financed and dispatched his son Siira Bugembe, nephews Yafesi Ssali and Labani Kiggundu, and other youths to fight alongside the British. Administrative appointments soon followed: Gombolola chief of Mutuba VI, then Saza Chief of Bugerere (1922) and acting Saza Chief of Ssingo (1924). He championed coffee, cotton, and food production, toured counties by bicycle and lorry, convened chiefs to strengthen governance, and even hunted a lion that threatened locals—refusing to shrink from duty.</p>

            <h2>Career Highlights</h2>
            <p>Nsibirwa’s leadership reached its height under Kabaka Sir Daudi Chwa II, who relied on him as Katikkiro until 1939 and entrusted him with raising princes George William Kimbugwe and Henry Kimera. He organized royal weddings, launched construction of Twekobe and chiefs’ residences, safeguarded Bulange’s treasury, and mobilized educated youth (including his sons) to serve abroad during World War II.</p>
            <p>Honors followed: membership in the Order of the British Empire, the ceremonial title of Master of Shield and Spear, and enduring respect from Kabaka Muteesa II, who described him as a wise elder able to “discern the right thing and execute it with dispatch.” His tenure coincided with the rise of formally educated Baganda civil servants, and he balanced tradition with pragmatism—exemplified by his support for the Namasole’s right to remarry, a stance that cost him the Katikkiro’s seat in 1941 but demonstrated his conviction that custom could evolve for righteous reasons.</p>

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>Nsibirwa married Damali Nawaggi in church in 1905 and later wed several other wives, including Veronica Namudu (Jjaja Bugerere), Erina Nankya (Jjaja Seeta), Kasalina Naku Ntabade (Jjaja Nakulabye), Maama Naome (mother of Kosayi Waggwa and Joyce Nakalema Serunjogi), and Mama Edisa Nabunya (mother of Seruwagi). Within the expansive Butikiro compound, each mother kept a household while the children were raised collectively—educated at Mengo Secondary School regardless of parentage, and bonded through nightly family prayers led by Nsibirwa.</p>
            <p>His faith guided daily routines: dawn prayers at Namirembe Cathedral, evening devotions at home, and a humble refusal to receive Holy Communion because of the Church’s stance on polygamy. The household operated with dedicated stewards—driver Malaki Matovu, financial steward Yakoba Nsubuga, valet Anderea, medical aide Leo Ssebingi, lorry driver Yosia Musisi (who hauled matooke from Kalasa as royal tax), and butcher Sowedi. Their service reflected Nsibirwa’s commitment to order, generosity, and unity, values that continue to define his descendants.</p>

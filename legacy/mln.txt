Navigation:
in the family tree once we click a child we are taken to the child's page who also has more children

add a feature where users can add new content to the family tree while keeping the site static

Also add a search bar for finding relatives, events etc.

I would also like a RAG chatbot but one where I don't have to spend on embeddings or generation


The Logo Should be MLN
